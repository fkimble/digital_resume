                <p>
                    As a photographer for Abundant Grace Chapel International, I had the privilege of capturing key moments during church services, community programs, and special events. 
                    My photography played a vital role in enhancing the church's social media presence, creating engaging content that resonated with both the congregation and the wider community. 
                    Through my work, I documented baptisms, choir performances, and outreach activities, each photograph telling a story of connection and faith. These images were often used to promote events and 
                    share uplifting messages, helping the church reach a broader audience. In addition to taking photos, I contributed to organizing the church's visual media strategy by curating galleries and 
                    offering input on how to optimize social media posts for greater engagement. This experience not only sharpened my technical skills in photography and editing but also deepened my understanding 
                    of the power of visual storytelling. I collaborated closely with church leaders to ensure that the content aligned with their mission and values, fostering a sense of trust and shared purpose. 
                    Being part of this community effort taught me the importance of teamwork and communication in achieving a common goal. Overall, my role as a photographer was a meaningful way to give back to a community 
                    that has been an integral part of my journey.

                            <p>
                                This video, titled "Thank You!", was created as a heartfelt expression of gratitude to my fellow peer mentors, advisors, and the living-learning communities that have significantly 
                                impacted my academic and personal growth. It highlights key moments and achievements, combining visuals and narration to showcase the journey that shaped who I am today. This project, 
                                crafted for my SOCY 396 class, also serves as a tribute to the incredible work my Residential Assistant did for my floor during my freshman and sophomore years at university. To capture the video, 
                                I used a Sony Handycam Camcorder for the phone call sequences, while all the photos were taken using my iPhone 14. I then brought everything together in Adobe Premiere Pro, where I carefully edited 
                                the footage to align with my creative vision. This project taught me the value of storytelling through visual media and the importance of recognizing those who inspire and uplift others. I also gained 
                                technical experience in video production and editing, which has further deepened my appreciation for multimedia projects. Ultimately, this video was not just a class assignment but a personal 
                                expression of gratitude and a reminder of the profound impact supportive communities can have on one's journey.

                    As a peer mentor in the Shriver Living-Learning Community, I guided students in their civic engagement and service-learning activities, helping them discover their passion for community involvement. 
                    The Shriver Center plays an essential role in connecting students with service opportunities that promote social change and personal growth. Through my mentorship, I aimed to empower students to take initiative and contribute meaningfully to the community. 
                    It was rewarding to witness students develop their skills and confidence as they engaged in various projects. The Shriver Center's UMBC account serves as a platform to promote their mission and activities, reaching both on-campus and off-campus audiences. 
                    By sharing updates, stories, and event highlights, the account encourages students and community members to get involved and take advantage of the opportunities available.
